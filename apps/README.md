# Applications

In this directory you find all our example applications. Both applications are packaged up in container images, which you can find here:

* `skaylinkgmbh/ix-multicloud-demo-petra:latest`
* `skaylinkgmbh/ix-multicloud-demo-klaus:latest`

Additionally you can find a `docker-compose.yml` file, to actually be able to run the applications right from this folder. Try it out.

You will notice that these applications are not really useful and are just representations in our complete example for real applications. They will only ping each other and print "hello world" in the end.

_Create your own useful applications and share them with us! This is just an example how deployment could look like._
