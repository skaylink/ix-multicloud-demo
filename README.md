# iX Article: "Multi-Cloud != Kubernetes" Demo

This repository is the hands-on demo for the iX article "Multi-Cloud != Kubernetes". It contains some basic terraform specifications for the three Hyperscaler, two example applications and it's helm charts to install onto the clusters. And on top some of the tests to actually proof it's multi-cloud capabilities.

Since the article is on german, we will still keep the documentation on english, so that you can share your learnings to your non-german colleges or the world-wide Kubernetes community.

_Waiting for your feedback in the issues!_
